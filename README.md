# Sign-Language-Detection-Using-LSTM-and-DTW

## Gesture Recognition with LSTM Networks

### Overview

This project focuses on building a gesture recognition system that leverages Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to detect and interpret sign language gestures from video inputs. The system is designed to process videos of various durations and reliably identify the corresponding gestures, thereby improving communication accessibility for individuals with hearing impairments.

### Key Features

- **LSTM Networks:** Implements LSTM networks to capture and analyze temporal patterns, enabling the model to effectively handle videos of different lengths.
- **High Accuracy:** The model achieves a test accuracy of 86%, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting sign language gestures with precision.
- **Real-World Relevance:** Designed for practical use, this system can enhance interactions between hearing-impaired individuals and the wider community.
- **Integration Potential:** The system can be incorporated into assistive devices and applications for real-time sign language translation.

### Usage

#### Data Collection and Preprocessing:

1. Gather videos representing various sign language gestures and organize them into datasets.
2. Preprocess the video data to extract essential features and prepare it for model training.

#### Training the Model:

1. Use the provided Python script to train the gesture recognition model.
2. Adjust model parameters and architecture as required.
3. Train the model on the prepared training dataset.

#### Evaluation:

1. Test the trained model using a separate test dataset to assess its accuracy.
2. Review the model's performance and fine-tune as necessary for optimal results.
